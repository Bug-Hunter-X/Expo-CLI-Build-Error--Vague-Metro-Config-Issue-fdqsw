# Expo CLI Build Error: Vague Metro Config Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered while building an Expo project using the Expo CLI. The error originates from a vague `metro-config` issue, where the error messages are not specific enough to easily diagnose the problem. The project previously built successfully, suggesting a potential incompatibility introduced by an update.

## Bug Description

While running `expo start`, the build process fails due to a `metro-config` related error.  The error messages are often cryptic, lacking detail on the exact cause of the problem.  Standard troubleshooting steps such as cache clearing and dependency reinstallation have not solved the issue.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the `metro.config.js` file, looking for inconsistencies or incorrect configurations. In this particular case, a missing or incorrectly configured resolver was identified as the root cause. The corrected `metro.config.js` is provided in this repository.  Ensure your project's dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with your Expo SDK version.
