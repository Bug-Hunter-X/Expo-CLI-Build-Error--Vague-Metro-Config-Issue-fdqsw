While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `metro-config` configuration. The error message was not very descriptive, making it difficult to identify the root cause.  The error occurred when trying to start the development server using `expo start`. The specific error message varied, sometimes indicating a problem with resolving modules or a missing dependency, but always stemming from a `metro-config` issue.  I tried clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking the `metro.config.js` file for any obvious mistakes, but none of these steps resolved the problem. The project had previously been building successfully, so I suspect a recent update might have introduced the incompatibility.
